**Summary Report:**
https://manasvchhabra.github.io/gas-simulation-report


This project focuses on the simulation of fundamental physics concepts, particularly particle dynamics and the principles of energy conservation, as described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The goal is to create a comprehensive visual representation of how particles behave in various scenarios, allowing for a deeper understanding of their interactions.

The simulation encompasses a variety of physical phenomena, including the dynamics of particle collisions, the visualization of energy transfer, and the analysis of momentum conservation. By utilizing advanced programming techniques and physics algorithms, I aim to replicate realistic particle behavior and generate insightful visualizations that illustrate the underlying principles of physics.

**Getting Started**

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

> Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/BatMandor/Gas-Simulation.git
    cd Gas-Simulation

> Set Up the Workspace:

    Make sure you run the setup script to install all necessary dependencies:
    python setup_workspace.py

> Run the Simulation:
    Execute the simulation script located in the root folder:
    
    python simulation.py
    
You will be prompted to enter the number of collisions for the simulation. Enter a positive integer and press Enter.


The simulation utilizes the MultiBallSimulation class located in the thermosnooker folder.
